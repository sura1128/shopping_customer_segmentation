# shopping_customer_segmentation
[WIP]: Studying customer segmentation using K-Clustering.

Pastels & Peaches is a popular fashion company with an online store which records customer statistics such as demographics, what they bought, how many of them have subscriptions, shipping and payment methods, etc. As a business intelligence analyst / product manager for their website, I want to be able to study this data and answer a few questions:

1. What are some changes I can implement in the website to improve customer retention?
2. What are some features I can add or optimize to make the shopping experience more personalized for each customer?
3. What are some tailored marketing campaigns I can use to promote sales and revenue for Pastels & Peaches while retaining customer satisfaction?
